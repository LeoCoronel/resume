Since joining Banco Comafi in 2023, I have been actively involved in a significant project focused on the "Individuos" segment. Initially centered around traditional credit card sales, my team and I successfully transitioned the process into a fully digital experience. This development not only streamlined the sales process but also significantly increased digital sales for both credit cards and savings accounts at the bank.
My participation in this project has been important in advancing the bank's digital initiatives and improving the overall customer experience. I am grateful to have the opportunity to contribute to the team and learn along the way.
